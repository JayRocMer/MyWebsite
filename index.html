        <p> You'll start out without any gear but will have a chest full of tools and food, if you chose to do so before
            creating your World. After that, you'll want to build a shelter to protect everyone from angry mobs. During
            the day, attack chickens, sheep, cows, or pigs, to feed yourself and your family and keep your energy bar
            full! </p>
